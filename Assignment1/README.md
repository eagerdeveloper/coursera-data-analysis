## Statistical Inference using Loan Data
The assignment involves using a loan dataset, and trying to infer how interest rates vary with FICO ranges, 
along with writing a report. I used linear regression in R.

There are 3 folders:
* code - contains the code for analysis
* data - contains the loan data, and a .rda file
* submit - contains 3 PDF documents:
  1. loansAnalysisFinal.pdf - this is the final report that explains the final analysis
  2. loanFigureFinal.pdf - contains the figure generated by the R code for analysis 
  3. loanFigureCaptionFinal.pdf - caption for figure in the above document
