## Predictive Analysis using Samsung Data
The assignment involves trying to predict the activity of a number of subjects, along with writing a report. 
I used Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest models in R for prediction, and compared the prediction accuracy for each.

There are 3 folders:
* code - contains the code for analysis
* data - contains the Samsung data
* submit - contains 3 PDF documents:
  1. samsungDataAnalysisFinal.pdf - this is the final report that explains the final analysis
  2. finalPredictionFigure.pdf - contains the prediction generated by SVM and random forest generated by the R code
  3. predictionFigureCaption.pdf - caption for figure in the above document
